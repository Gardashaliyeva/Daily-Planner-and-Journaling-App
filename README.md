# My Unified Daily Planner
This is a web-based daily planner and journal designed to help users track their tasks and reflect on their day. The application is built with a focus on Islamic principles, incorporating "Dini" (religious) and "Dünyəvi" (worldly) task categories.

## Features
* **Daily and Weekly Task Management**: Create, track, and complete both daily and weekly tasks.
* **Progress Tracking**: Visualize your daily progress with dynamic progress bars for both religious and worldly tasks.
* **Streak Tracker**: Maintain a daily streak by completing a configurable percentage of your daily tasks.
* **Journaling**: A dedicated journal section allows users to reflect on their learning, achievements, and moments of gratitude, including space for a dua or ayah.
* **Progress Charts**: View your progress over time with charts that display completed and total tasks on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
* **Persistent Storage**: All data, including tasks, journal entries, and streak information, is securely stored in a Firestore database, ensuring it persists across sessions.

## Technologies
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript.
* **Charting**: Chart.js for data visualization.
